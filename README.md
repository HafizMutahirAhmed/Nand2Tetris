# Nand to Tetris Hardware Projects 🛠️💻

This repository contains all the hardware design files and project work completed as part of the **Nand to Tetris** course. It covers the entire hardware stack from basic logic gates to a working CPU built from NAND gates and combinational/sequential components.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- **Basic Gates** — Built from NAND gates
- **Combinational Circuits** — Adders, multiplexers, etc.
- **Sequential Circuits** — Flip-flops, registers, RAM
- **CPU Design** — Instruction set implementation and control logic
- **Project Files** — HDL files, simulation waveforms, and documentation

## 🧠 About Nand to Tetris

This course guides you through building a modern computer from the ground up, starting with the simplest NAND gate. The projects gradually combine components to build an 8-bit CPU capable of running programs, illustrating fundamental computer architecture concepts.

## ▶️ How to Use

- All hardware designs are implemented in HDL (Hardware Description Language).
- Use your preferred HDL simulator or hardware emulator to compile and simulate these designs.
- Refer to the project files for step-by-step progress and testing instructions.
